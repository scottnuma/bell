                            Bell quickly tells how many minutes of class are left. Whether at zero, break, or the last class of the
                            day, Bell calculates the time remaining. This is
                        currently the fourth major version of Bell, revamped for
                        the 2014-2015 school year. Bell first launched back in 
                        2013 or so.
